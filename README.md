# CloudSim-PowerDatacenter-Project

This project is done for the course "Cloud Computing 98/2" in Razi University. There are 2 datacenters, each has 3 VMs. The dataset LCG2005 is used. 

Objectives are as follows:
 - Amount of energy consumption of each datacenter, number of VM migrations and average response time
 - Pause simulation at a given time and investigate the number of tasks in each VM and the amount of processing capacity
 - Migrate a VM manually
